# Supervised-Learning
Using labelled classifed data to infer a learning algorithm in R

## Overview
The objective of this analysis is to apply supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to the dataset to develop prediction models for which customers are likely to pay or default on loans.

## Dataset 
The data is obtained from a german bank containing information about loans granted to its customers. It contains 900 observations, with 21 variables.
